# BenchBot Add-ons Manager

![Sample of all the different add-ons available](./docs/benchbot_addons.gif)

The BenchBot Add-ons Manager allows you to use BenchBot with a wide array of additional content, and customise your installation to suite your needs. Semantic Scene Understanding not your thing? Install the Semantic Question Answering add-ons instead. Want to create your own content? Write some basic YAML files to make your own add-ons. Need to re-use existing content? Simply include a dependency on that add-on. Add-ons are all about making BenchBot whatever you need it to be&mdash;build a BenchBot for your research problems, exactly as you need it.
